## Problem: 
Digital softwares and internet accessibility have changed the horizons of travel possibilities. Any wanderlust traveler curious about other places, peoples, and cultures can search for locations, flights, and accommodations using today's available software. While it may seem as though booking travel is as accessible, quick, and navigatable as can be, that is not the case. Today's current travel software presents challenges to travelers seeking viable travel opportunities dependent on visa and origin locations. Currently, aviation opportunities and travel sites separate travel regulation information and transportation or destination information. A traveler in the current market can research destinations for travel, visa regulations, and aviation opportunities; however, the process is complicated, layered, and time-consuming. Motivated travelers will continue to jump through the required hoops to be able to travel, despite the lack of cohesive travel planning and organization software in the market.
